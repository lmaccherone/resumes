## Executive Summary

Repeat 0→1 builder and category creator across Engineering, ML/Data Science, App/API Security, and most recently AI/MCP. I turn ambiguity into adoption: assemble small A‑teams, prototype fast to de‑risk, run design‑partner loops, and ship secure‑by‑default architectures—then scale through developer ecosystems and executive engagement. Track record: founding director of CMU CyLab; created Rally’s Insights product line; led Comcast’s DevSecOps platform transformation; authored the DevSecOps Manifesto; advanced MCP standards. I invest in and rely on quantitative feedback loops to inform strategy and execution—especially when the signal contradicts the status quo, conventional wisdom, or my first instincts.

## How I’ll Help an AI + App/API Sec Startup

### 0→1 Execution Highlights

- **Find and frame:** Leverage investor/founder/advisor insight (and my own) to spot opportunities and probe for a product‑category wave.
- **MVP fast:** Build rapid MVPs to locate the max intersection of desirability and feasibility.
- **Validate with partners:** Recruit 2–3 design partners; validate demand via A/B tests and lightweight experiments.
- **Execute and focus:** Ship product + quickstarts + self‑serve; cut low‑impact work and double down on what moves the needle.

### C-suite Roundtables and Deal Acceleration

- **Hosted 12+ per year** executive roundtables, breakfasts, and dinners to steer thinking and harvest market insight.
- **Utilized devil’s‑advocate plant** to surface objections and drive alignment with our strategy.
- **Outcomes:** One event yielded **5 POC commitments in a week**; at Contrast, **60%+ of POCs** originated from these events (continued post‑employment on contract).

### Standards & Specs Leadership

- **MCP WebSocket transport SEP:** Authored a WebSocket transport SEP under consideration for the next MCP spec, with a reference implementation on an edge/serverless platform supporting hibernating connection state; demonstrated why WebSockets fit long‑lived, bidirectional communication better than Streamable HTTP.

### Developer Adoption & Community Growth

- **Developer thought leadership:** Delivered 30+ talks/workshops/webinars; produced content that turned complex topics into actionable guidance.
- **Active community engagement:** Supported developer communities (Discord/forums), unblocking implementations and driving docs/bugfix/product improvements.
- **DevSecOps leadership:** Authored the original DevSecOps Manifesto and a widely adopted Transformation Blueprint (adopted by BMW, CVS, Comcast, others).

### Hands-on Engineering & OSS Impact

- **Open source leadership:** Authored 12+ open source projects, including one with 1M+ monthly downloads, used by every major cloud vendor and cryptocurrency platform.
- **Stateful edge/serverless OSS:** Built two open-source projects targeting stateful edge/serverless runtimes, demonstrating practical expertise with modern distributed application patterns.
- **Algorithmic innovation:** Designed a competition-winning ML algorithm for temporal-hierarchical predictive modeling, in use at BMW, Broadcom, and Pendo.

### Relevant Professional Results

- **Breakthrough deployment architecture (Contrast):**
  - Prototyped the first Kubernetes sidecar deployment to accelerate rollouts beyond one‑app‑at‑a‑time limitations.
  - Led a cross‑functional engineering effort to implement the best at‑scale deployment approach for popular runtime environments.
  - **Result:** Almost all Contrast deployments now use this architecture, significantly improving deployment speed and scalability.  

- **DevOps before DevSecOps (Comcast):**  
  - Directed engineering resources to build both security-focused and general-purpose CI/CD plugins.  
  - Achieved 3 of the top 5 and 4 of the top 10 most-used CI plugins across Comcast's CI/CD platforms.  
  - **Result:** Flipped perception of Comcast security from a gatekeeper to an enabler of faster value delivery.  

- **Enticing by delighting (Comcast):**  
  - Served as product owner for the Security Central platform, gradually winning internal competition against 7 other systems by delivering a delightful user experience that accelerated usage.  
  - Reduced engineering overhead from 40 to 10 FTE by consolidating and streamlining security tooling.  
  - **Result:** Gave executives, developer leaders, and practitioners one place to go for all security-related needs, while reducing costs and enticing exploratory adoption.

- **Analytics platform evolution (Rally):**  
  - Transitioned from a field role to product ownership by developing analytics tooling that overcame platform limitations.  
  - Built a replacement analytics engine that evolved into the Insights product line, demonstrating hands-on technical leadership driving product strategy.  
  - **Result:** Established a new product line that became a key differentiator for Rally while opening up the ability to provide analytics on top of competitive software project management tools like Jira, which is now the dominant underlying platform for Broadcom Insights revenue.

## Relevant Professional History

### Contrast Security (2021-2025) | **Transformation Architect**
*Reporting to CTO • Product Council Member (1 of 6)*
- **Drove forward and steered product strategy:** Facilitated practitioner workshops, hosted C-suite roundtables, and presented at industry events as feedback mechanisms and to drive market acceptance; also led a breakthrough Kubernetes sidecar deployment architecture later adopted for almost all Contrast deployments, improving rollout speed and scalability.
- **Created high-impact content:** (40K+ impressions per post) that both advanced and refined--through community feedback--go-to-market strategy
- **Mentorship:** Maintained continuous mentorship of roughly 3 engineering and product leaders, developing Contrast's next-generation talent

### Comcast (2016-2021) | **Executive Director → Distinguished Engineer**
*Direct CISO hire • Enterprise-wide development organization transformation*
- **Transform mindset and practices:** Led DevSecOps transformation across 600 engineering teams and 10,000+ developers, via coaching and toolsmithing approach to transformation in contrast to ineffective and confrontational gatekeeping approach. **Result:** Reduced dependency on siloed security experts, enabling faster and more secure product development.  
- **Toolsmithing to empower developers via self-service:** Swapped out entire suite of existing tools that catered to siloed security expert usage with self-service developer-friendly alternatives that empowered product teams to own the security of their products.  
- **Distributed technical team leadership:** Guided engineering and security teams across multiple subsidiaries (Comcast, Sky, NBC Universal, DreamWorks, etc.).  
- **Platform engineering pioneer:** Strategically transitioned to Distinguished Engineer role to establish enterprise-wide platform engineering capability.
- **Reachability analysis popularization:** Championed reachability analysis for alert prioritization—later adopted broadly across the ecosystem—improving remediation focus and reducing noise.
