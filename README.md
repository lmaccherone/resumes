# Larry Maccherone - Resume Repository

This repository contains various versions of my resume tailored for different roles, with a focus on Product and Engineering leadership positions.

## Files

- `product-engineering-matrix.md` - Matrix-style resume highlighting Product Leadership, Engineering Leadership, and Data-driven decision making across my career
- `text-versions-from-word-docs/` - Text versions of traditional resume formats

## About the Matrix Format

The matrix-style resume demonstrates how throughout my career, I've consistently combined:
- **Product Leadership** - Driving product vision, strategy, and adoption
- **Engineering Leadership** - Leading technical teams and building developer tools
- **Data-driven Decision Making** - Using quantitative methods to measure and improve outcomes

This format is particularly relevant for roles that require both product and engineering leadership, such as Head of Product and Engineering positions.
