## Executive Summary

My career has been dedicated to empowering developers and driving adoption of transformative technologies, aligning perfectly with Cloudflare's mission to create a paradigm-shifting but delightful developer experience. In every role, I’ve led the creation of solutions—from product, engineering, and ecosystem perspectives—that significantly enhance the performance and scalability of engineering work. Combining deep hands-on technical leadership with market foresight, I’ve consistently driven adoption, influenced industry standards, and delivered lasting change.

## How I Can Help Cloudflare

### Cloudflare-Specific Contributions

- **WebSocket transport SEP:** Authored a WebSocket transport SEP under consideration for the next MCP specification, with a Cloudflare-based reference implementation. This leverages Durable Objects' ability to maintain connections while hibernating, making WebSockets a much better fit for Cloudflare's architecture than the current MCP network transport, Streamable HTTP.
- **Durable Objects ecosystem contributions:** Developed two open-source projects specifically targeting the Durable Objects ecosystem, demonstrating deep expertise and commitment to Cloudflare's developer community.
- **Active community engagement:** Recognized as a leading contributor on Cloudflare's #durable-objects Discord channel, consistently helping developers solve implementation challenges and providing guidance.

### Industry Ecosystem Leadership & Standards Influence

- **Cultivating the ecosystem my employer inhabits:** Like the WebSocket for MCP proposal mentioned above, I have often cultivated the ecosystem my employer inhabits to create a more fertile environment in which to flourish and grow. Two more examples:
  - **AppSec transformation (Comcast):** Championed reachability analysis, now the industry standard for security alert prioritization, enabling tools across the ecosystem to better serve Comcast and my subsequent employer, Contrast.
  - **DevSecOps leadership:** Authored the original DevSecOps Manifesto and created a widely adopted "Transformation Blueprint," driving adoption at BMW, CVS, Comcast, and more, fostering a thriving and developer-centric security ecosystem.

### Developer Community Leadership & Technical Recognition

- **Cloudflare community contributor:** Recognized as a leading voice on Cloudflare's #durable-objects Discord channel, helping developers solve challenges and adopt Cloudflare technologies, while providing actionable feedback to Cloudflare employees for documentation, bug fix, and product enhancements.
- **Advisory roles:** Served as Azure Advisor for Cosmos DB query language design and Microsoft MVP for AI and Analytics, bridging product management with developer needs.
- **Developer thought leadership:** Delivered engaging conference talks, created impactful content, and drove adoption through social media, consistently making complex technical concepts accessible.

### Technical Leadership & Open Source Impact

- **Open source leadership:** Authored 12+ open source projects, including one with 1M+ monthly downloads, used by every major cloud vendor and cryptocurrency platform.  
- **Cloudflare-specific contributions:** Created two open-source projects targeting the Durable Objects ecosystem, showcasing deep expertise and commitment to Cloudflare's developer community.  
- **Algorithmic innovation:** Designed a competition-winning ML algorithm for temporal-hierarchical predictive modeling, in use at BMW, Broadcom, and Pendo.  
- **AI/MCP relevance:** ML/analytics background is a strong foundation for what has followed, AI and MCP  
- **Prototype-driven strategy:** Used hands-on technical prototyping to explore possibilities, validate concepts, and demonstrate feasibility before full-scale development.

### Product Leadership for Developer Platforms

- **Breakthrough deployment architecture (Contrast):**  
  - Prototyped the first Kubernetes sidecar deployment to accelerate rollouts beyond one-app-at-a-time limitations.  
  - Led a cross-functional engineering effort to implement the best at-scale deployment approach for popular runtime environments.  
  - **Result:** Almost all Contrast deployments now use this architecture, significantly improving deployment speed and scalability.  

- **DevOps before DevSecOps (Comcast):**  
  - Directed engineering resources to build both security-focused and general-purpose CI/CD plugins.  
  - Achieved 3 of the top 5 and 4 of the top 10 most-used CI plugins across Comcast's CI/CD platforms.  
  - **Result:** Flipped perception of Comcast security from a gatekeeper to an enabler of faster value delivery.  

- **Enticing by delighting (Comcast):**  
  - Served as product owner for the Security Central platform, gradually winning internal competition against 7 other systems by delivering a delightful user experience that accelerated usage.  
  - Reduced engineering overhead from 40 to 10 FTE by consolidating and streamlining security tooling.  
  - **Result:** Gave executives, developer leaders, and practitioners one place to go for all security-related needs, while reducing costs and enticing exploratory adoption.

- **Analytics platform evolution (Rally):**  
  - Transitioned from a field role to product ownership by developing analytics tooling that overcame platform limitations.  
  - Built a replacement analytics engine that evolved into the Insights product line, demonstrating hands-on technical leadership driving product strategy.  
  - **Result:** Established a new product line that became a key differentiator for Rally while opening up the ability to provide analytics on top of competitive software project management tools like Jira, which is now the dominant underlying platform for Broadcom Insights revenue.

## Quantified Impact

- **83% reduction** in production vulnerabilities at Comcast through Dev[Sec]Ops transformation
- **3x faster** vulnerability remediation using runtime security tools at Contrast
- **10,000+ developers** impacted by platform engineering initiatives at Comcast
- **1M+ downloads/month** for open source projects I authored and in-use by all major cloud providers
- **40,000+ impressions** per thought leadership post, both driving forward and--via pushback against those posts--steering product strategy

## Professional Experience

### Contrast Security (2021-2025) | **Transformation Architect**
*Reporting to CTO • Product Council Member (1 of 6)*
- **Drove forward and steered product strategy:** Facilitated practitioner workshops, hosted C-suite roundtables, and presented at industry events all of which served as both feedback mechanisms and opportunities to drive industry acceptance of our vision
- **Created high-impact content:** (40K+ impressions per post) that both advanced and refined--through community feedback--go-to-market strategy
- **Mentorship:** Maintained continuous mentorship of roughly 3 engineering and product leaders, developing Contrast's next-generation talent

### Comcast (2016-2021) | **Executive Director → Distinguished Engineer**
*Direct CISO hire • Enterprise-wide development organization transformation*
- **Transform mindset and practices:** Led DevSecOps transformation across 600 engineering teams and 10,000+ developers, via coaching and toolsmithing approach to transformation in contrast to ineffective and confrontational gatekeeping approach. **Result:** Reduced dependency on siloed security experts, enabling faster and more secure product development.  
- **Toolsmithing to empower developers via self-service:** Swapped out entire suite of existing tools that catered to silo'd security expert usage with self-service developer-friendly alternatives that empowered product teams to own the security of their products.
