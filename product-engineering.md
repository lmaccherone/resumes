## Executive Summary

In every role, I've driven—from product, engineering, and ecosystem perspectives—the development of solutions that dramatically improve the performance of engineering organizations at scale.

**Core value proposition:** I consistently combine deep hands-on technical leadership with seeing-around-corners market insights, using data-driven approaches to drive adoption, influence industry standards, and accomplish lasting change.

## Strategic Value for Cloudflare

### Industry Ecosystem Leadership & Standards Influence

- **Current Cloudflare impact:** Author of WebSocket transport SEP under consideration for next MCP specification, developed with Cloudflare-based reference implementation. With Durable Object's ability to maintain the connection while hibernating, WebSockets is an infinitely better fit for Cloudflare's architecture than MCP's existing network transport, Streamable HTTP.

- **Career-long pattern of ecosystem enhancement** that creates competitive advantages for employers:
  - **AppSec industry transformation (Comcast):** Drove vendors to implement reachability analysis—now the industry standard for security alert prioritization, benefiting tools across the ecosystem including my next employer, Contrast Security
  - **Agile/DevOps methodology leadership (Rally/Broadcom):** Published the largest-ever study correlating lean and agile practices with software engineering team performance—now a foundational reference for those methodologies
  - **DevSecOps movement creation:** Authored original DevSecOps Manifesto that launched the developer-centric security movement, now adopted at BMW, CVS, Comcast, and other major organizations worldwide

### Developer Community Leadership & Technical Recognition

- **Active Cloudflare community contributor:** Recognized as one of the most responsive and respected contributors on Cloudflare's #durable-objects Discord channel, consistently providing technical guidance and helping community members solve implementation challenges
- **Platform advisory roles:** Former Azure Advisor for Cosmos DB query language design and Microsoft MVP for AI and Analytics—appointed based on technical expertise and demonstrated ability to bridge product development with developer community needs
- **Thought leadership for developer audiences:** Consistent track record of presenting complex technical concepts in a manner that is both effective and entertaining through conference talks, content creation, and social media engagement that drives developer adoption

### Technical Leadership & Open Source Impact

- **Widely-adopted open source contributions:** Primary author of 12+ open source projects, including one with 1M+ monthly downloads used by every major cloud vendor and cryptocurrency platform. Two projects specifically target Cloudflare Durable Objects ecosystem, demonstrating deep Cloudflare expertise and commitment to Cloudflare's developer community.
- **Advanced algorithmic innovation:** Developed competition-winning ML algorithm for temporal-hierarchical predictive modeling, deployed in production at BMW (dynamic BoMs), Broadcom (evolving org structures), and Pendo (DOM hierarchy interactions). This deep AI/ML foundation directly translates to understanding modern AI tooling architectures and developer needs.
- **Prototype-driven product strategy:** Consistently lead product vision through hands-on technical prototyping—using code to explore possibilities, validate concepts, and demonstrate technical feasibility before committing engineering resources to full development.

### Product Leadership for Developer Platforms

- **Breakthrough deployment architecture (Contrast):** Prototyped first K8s sidecar deployment model to accelerate rollouts beyond previous one-app-at-a-time limitations. Then, led cross-functional engineering effort to extend this approach across diverse runtime environments—now the primary deployment model for Contrast.
- **Developer tooling strategy (Comcast):** Directed my engineering resources to build both security-focused and general-purpose CI/CD plugins, recognizing that developer adoption requires solving broader workflow challenges. Our's were 3 of top 5 and 4 of top 10 most-used CI plugins across Comcast's CI/CD platforms.
- **Platform consolidation leadership (Comcast):** Served as product owner for Security Central platform that replaced 7 existing systems while reducing engineering overhead from 40 to 10 FTE—demonstrating ability to architect scalable solutions that improve both developer experience and operational efficiency.
- **Analytics platform evolution (Rally):** Rapidly transitioned from field role to product ownership by personally developing analytics tooling that overcame platform limitations. Built replacement analytics engine that evolved into the Insights product line—showcasing pattern of hands-on technical leadership driving product strategy.

## Quantified Impact

- **83% reduction** in production vulnerabilities at Comcast through Dev[Sec]Ops transformation
- **3x faster** vulnerability remediation using runtime security tools at Contrast
- **10,000+ developers** impacted by platform engineering initiatives at Comcast
- **1M+ downloads/month** for open source projects I authored and in-use by all major cloud providers
- **40,000+ impressions** per thought leadership post, both driving forward and--via pushback against those posts--steering product strategy
