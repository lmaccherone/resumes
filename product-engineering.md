## Executive Summary

In every role, I've driven—from product, engineering, and ecosystem perspectives—the development of solutions that measurably improve the performance of engineering organizations at scale.

**Core value proposition:** I consistently combine deep hands-on technical leadership with strategic product vision, using data-driven approaches to drive adoption, influence industry standards, and deliver quantifiable business impact.

## Strategic Value for Cloudflare

### Industry Ecosystem Leadership & Standards Influence

- **Current Cloudflare impact:** Author of WebSocket transport SEP under consideration for next MCP specification, developed with Cloudflare-based reference implementation. With Durable Object's ability to hibernate, WebSockets is an infinitely better fit for Cloudflare's architecture than MCP's existing network transport, Streamable HTTP.

- **Career-long pattern of ecosystem enhancement** that creates competitive advantages for employers:
  - **AppSec industry transformation (Comcast):** Drove vendors to implement reachability analysis—now the industry standard for security alert prioritization, benefiting tools across the ecosystem including my next employer, Contrast Security
  - **Agile/DevOps methodology leadership (Rally/Broadcom):** Published the largest-ever study correlating lean and agile practices with software engineering team performance—now a foundational reference for those methodologies
  - **DevSecOps movement creation:** Authored original DevSecOps Manifesto that launched the developer-centric security movement, now adopted at BMW, CVS, Comcast, and other major organizations worldwide

### Developer Community Leadership & Technical Recognition

- **Active technical contributor:** Recognized as one of the most responsive and respected contributors on Cloudflare's #durable-objects Discord channel, consistently providing technical guidance and helping community members solve complex implementation challenges
- **Platform advisory roles:** Former Azure Advisor for Cosmos DB query language design and Microsoft MVP for AI and Analytics—appointed based on technical expertise and demonstrated ability to bridge product development with developer community needs
- **Thought leadership for developer audiences:** Consistent track record of presenting complex technical concepts in a manner that is both engaging and entertaining through conference talks, content creation, and social media engagement that drives developer adoption

### Engineering

- I am the primary author of over a dozen open source projects, one of which gets over 1 million downloads per month and is used by every major cloud vendor and cryptocurrency wallet/exchange. Two of these open-source projects are for Cloudflare Durable Objects.
- I am the author of a competition-winning ML algorithm for temporal-hierarchical predictive modeling in use by BMW (BoMs that change over time), Broadcom (org-trees that change over time), Pendo (DOM hierarchies that change with user interaction), and others. This shows I have deep background that translates into understanding how AI works.
- Everywhere I've worked, I have consistently driven product vision by personally coding innovative prototypes.

### Product Leadership for Developer Platforms

- **Breakthrough deployment architecture (Contrast):** Prototyped first K8s sidecar deployment model to accelerate rollouts beyond previous one-app-at-a-time limitations. Then, led cross-functional engineering effort to extend this approach across diverse runtime environments—now the primary deployment model for Contrast.
- **Developer tooling strategy (Comcast):** Directed my engineering resources to build both security-focused and general-purpose CI/CD plugins, recognizing that developer adoption requires solving broader workflow challenges. Our's were 3 of top 5 and 4 of top 10 most-used CI plugins across Comcast's CI/CD platforms.
- **Platform consolidation leadership (Comcast):** Served as product owner for Security Central platform that replaced 7 existing systems while reducing engineering overhead from 40 to 10 FTE—demonstrating ability to architect scalable solutions that improve both developer experience and operational efficiency.
- **Analytics platform evolution (Rally):** Rapidly transitioned from field role to product ownership by personally developing analytics tooling that overcame platform limitations. Built replacement analytics engine that evolved into the Insights product line—showcasing pattern of hands-on technical leadership driving product strategy.
