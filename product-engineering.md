## tl;dr

In every role, I led--from a product, engineering, and ecosystem perspective--the development of products that improved the performance of engineering organizations. I consistently combine hands-on technical leadership with product strategy, using data-driven approaches to drive adoption and measure impact at scale.

## Narrative for Cloudflare

### Improving the ecosystem for my employer

- I am the author of the WebSocket transport SEP now in consideration for the next MCP spec. It was developed--and will be shipped--with a Cloudflare-based reference implementation. Because of hibernating WebSockets this is an infinitely better transport for Cloudflare's architecture than MCP's other network transport, Streamable HTTP.
- The above highlights a career-long pattern of bettering the ecosystem for my employer, in some cases even prior to employment. Similarly:
  - At Comcast, I drove AppSec vendors to implement reachability analysis that today is the key to prioritizing the tsunami of security alerts that many tool vendors--including my next employer, Contrast--benefits from today.
  - At Rally (now Broadcom), I published the largest ever study correlating lean and agile development practices with outcomes (productivity, predictability, quality, and responsiveness) which is now a foundational reference for organizations adopting these methodologies.
  - At Rally, I also published the original DevSecOps Manifesto that launched the developer-centric security movement and led me to become the head of AppSec for Comcast where I developed a framework for shift-left security across large enterprises. That framework was then adopted at BMW, CVS, and others.

### Community engagement

- I believe that I have earned the respect of both Cloudflare and community participants on the #durable-objects Discord channel by being among the most responsive contributors.
- I'm a former Azure Advisor for helping design the query language for Cosmos DB and I am a former Microsoft MVP for AI and Analytics offerings, in recognition of my community outreach for Microsoft/Azure products.

### Engineering

- I am the primary author of over a dozen open source projects, one of which gets over 1 million downloads per month and is used by every major cloud vendor and cryptocurrency wallet/exchange. Two of these open-source projects are for Cloudflare Durable Objects.
- I am the author of a competition-winning ML algorithm for temporal-hierarchical predictive modeling in use by BMW (BoMs that change over time), Broadcom (org-trees that change over time), Pendo (DOM hierarchies that change with user interaction), and others. This shows I have deep background that translates into understanding how AI works.
- Everywhere I've worked, I have consistently driven product vision by personally coding innovative prototypes.

### Product leadership

- At Contrast, I created the first K8s sidecar deployment to overcome the challenges of scaling deployments within customers one app at a time. I then led an engineering effort to create similar capability for environments besides K8s. Today, the vast majority of Contrast's usage is through these scaled deployment models.
- At Comcast, I directed my developer hires to build not just security-relevant CI plugins but also general purpose plugins to accelerate the adoption of DevOps. Our plugins accounted for 3 of the top 5 and 4 of the top 10 most used plugins for Comcast's CI/CD platforms.
- Also at Comcast, I was the product owner for 4 internal applications that were eventually merged into the one platform named Security Central which replaced 7 other systems saving millions in licensing costs as well as engineering effort. Roughly 40 FTE engineers were dedicated to the 7 systems that Security Central replaced and I only had 10 FTE engineers.
- I was hired at Rally into a field role, but within 6 months, I had personally developed analytics tooling to help our customers overcome limitations of the Rally analytics engine. From that success, I transitioned to a product owner role over the analytics team and I continued to develop my analytics platform to a replace the existing one. I was promoted to Director of the Insights product line and head of the Raleigh office. Today, I hear that Broadcom Insights brings in more revenue than the entire Rally organization did at its peak.
