## Executive Summary

In every role, I've driven—from product, engineering, and ecosystem perspectives—the development of solutions that dramatically improve the performance of engineering organizations at scale.

**Core value proposition:** I consistently combine deep hands-on technical leadership with seeing-around-corners market insights, using data-driven approaches to drive adoption, influence industry standards, and accomplish lasting change.

## Strategic Value for Cloudflare

### Industry Ecosystem Leadership & Standards Influence

- **Current Cloudflare impact:** Author of WebSocket transport SEP under consideration for next MCP specification, developed with Cloudflare-based reference implementation. With Durable Object's ability to maintain the connection while hibernating, WebSockets is an infinitely better fit for Cloudflare's architecture than MCP's existing network transport, Streamable HTTP.

- **Career-long pattern of ecosystem enhancement** that creates competitive advantages for employers:
  - **AppSec industry transformation (Comcast):** Drove vendors to implement reachability analysis—now the industry standard for security alert prioritization, benefiting tools across the ecosystem including my next employer, Contrast Security
  - **Agile/DevOps methodology leadership (Rally/Broadcom):** Published the largest-ever study correlating lean and agile practices with software engineering team performance—now a foundational reference for those methodologies
  - **DevSecOps movement push:** Authored original DevSecOps Manifesto at the beginning of the developer-centric security movement. Published a "Transformation Blueprint" for DevSecOps that is now adopted at BMW, CVS, Comcast, and other major organizations worldwide

### Developer Community Leadership & Technical Recognition

- **Active Cloudflare community contributor:** Recognized as one of the most responsive and respected contributors on Cloudflare's #durable-objects Discord channel, consistently providing guidance and helping community members solve implementation challenges
- **Platform advisory roles:** Former Azure Advisor for Cosmos DB query language design and Microsoft MVP for AI and Analytics. Was asppointed based on technical expertise and demonstrated ability to bridge product development with developer community needs
- **Thought leadership for developer audiences:** Consistent track record of presenting complex technical concepts in a manner that is both effective and entertaining through conference talks, content creation, and social media engagement that drives developer adoption

### Technical Leadership & Open Source Impact

- **Widely-adopted open source contributions:** Primary author of 12+ open source projects, including one with 1M+ monthly downloads used by every major cloud vendor and cryptocurrency platform. Two projects specifically target Cloudflare Durable Objects ecosystem, demonstrating deep Cloudflare expertise and commitment to Cloudflare's developer community
- **Advanced algorithmic innovation:** Developed competition-winning ML algorithm for temporal-hierarchical predictive modeling, deployed in production at BMW (dynamic BoMs), Broadcom (evolving org structures), and Pendo (DOM hierarchy changes via interactions). This deep AI/ML foundation directly translates to understanding modern AI tooling architectures and developer needs
- **Prototype-driven product strategy:** Consistently lead product vision through hands-on technical prototyping using code to explore possibilities, validate concepts, and demonstrate technical feasibility before committing engineering resources to full development

### Product Leadership for Developer Platforms

- **Breakthrough deployment architecture (Contrast):** Prototyped first K8s sidecar deployment to accelerate rollouts beyond previous one-app-at-a-time limitations. Then, led cross-functional engineering effort to implement the best at-scale deployment approach for each of the most popular runtime environments. Now, almost all Contrast deployments are done this way
- **DevOps before DevSecOps (Comcast):** Directed my engineering resources to build both security-focused and general-purpose CI/CD plugins because you can't have DevSecOps without DevOps. Our's were 3 of top 5 and 4 of top 10 most-used CI plugins across Comcast's CI/CD platforms and our most popular one was not security-related. This flipped the perception of Comcast security from a gatekeeper to one that helps you deliver value faster
- **Enticing by delighting (Comcast):** Served as product owner for Security Central platform eventually winning internal competition against 7 disparate systems run by other groups because ours was delightful to users. Besides accelerating usage, this had the side benefit of reducing engineering overhead from 40 to 10 FTE
- **Analytics platform evolution (Rally):** Rapidly transitioned from field role to product ownership by personally developing analytics tooling that overcame platform limitations for customers. Built replacement analytics engine that evolved into the Insights product line, showcasing pattern of hands-on technical leadership driving product strategy

## Quantified Impact

- **83% reduction** in production vulnerabilities at Comcast through Dev[Sec]Ops transformation
- **3x faster** vulnerability remediation using runtime security tools at Contrast
- **10,000+ developers** impacted by platform engineering initiatives at Comcast
- **1M+ downloads/month** for open source projects I authored and in-use by all major cloud providers
- **40,000+ impressions** per thought leadership post, both driving forward and--via pushback against those posts--steering product strategy

## Professional Experience

### Contrast Security (2021-2025) | **Transformation Architect**
*Reporting to CTO • Product Council Member (1 of 6)*
- **Drove forward and steered product strategy:** Facilitated practitioner workshops, hosted C-suite roundtables, and presented at industry events all of which served as both feedback mechanisms and opportunities to drive industry acceptance of our vision
- **Created high-impact content:** (40K+ impressions per post) that both advanced and refined--through community feedback--go-to-market strategy
- **Mentorship:** Maintained continuous mentorship of roughly 3 engineering and product leaders, developing Contrast's next-generation talent

### Comcast (2016-2021) | **Executive Director → Distinguished Engineer**
*Direct CISO hire • Enterprise-wide development organization transformation*
- **Transform mindset and practices:** Led DevSecOps transformation across 600 engineering teams and 10,000+ developers, via coaching and toolsmithing approach to transformation in contrast to ineffective and confrontational gatekeeping approach
- **Toolsmithing to empower developers via self-service:** Swapped out entire suite of existing tools that catered to silo'd security expert usage with self-service developer-friendly alternatives that empowered product teams to own the security of their products
- **Distributed technical team leadership:** Guided engineering and security teams across multiple subsidiaries (Comcast, Sky, NBC Universal, DreamWorks, etc.)
- **Platform engineering pioneer:** Strategically transitioned to Distinguished Engineer role to establish enterprise-wide platform engineering capability
